            <h5 class="fw-bold opacity-75">Conceptual Foundations (Early 20th Century)</h5>
            Quantum mechanics was developed, laying the theoretical groundwork for quantum computing.
            <br /><br />
            <h5 class="fw-bold opacity-75">Early Propositions (1980-1990s)</h5>
            Physicists like Paul Benioff, Richard Feynman, and David Deutsch proposed the concept of quantum computing.
            <br /><br />
            <h5 class="fw-bold opacity-75">First Physical Implementations (1990s-2000s)</h5>
            Various physical systems, such as trapped ions and superconducting circuits, were explored for implementing quantum bits.

            <h5 class="fw-bold opacity-75">Shor's Algorithm (1994)</h5>
            Peter Shor developed an algorithm for factoring large numbers efficiently on a quantum computer, sparking major interest in quantum computing.
            <br /><br />
            <h5 class="fw-bold opacity-75">Error Correction and Fault Tolerance (1990s-Present)</h5>
            Quantum error correction codes and fault-tolerant protocols were developed, a crucial step towards building practical quantum computers.
            <br /><br />
            <h5 class="fw-bold opacity-75">Commercial Quantum Computing (2010s-Present)</h5>
            Companies like IBM, Google, and others started building quantum processors and providing cloud-based quantum computing services.

            <h5 class="fw-bold opacity-75">Quantum Supremacy (2019)</h5>
            Google claimed "quantum supremacy" when their quantum computer solved a specific problem faster than a classical computer could. However, this didn't mean quantum computers were generally superior to classical ones as of that time.
            <br /><br />
            <h5 class="fw-bold opacity-75">Ongoing Developments (Present)</h5>
            Research in quantum computing is highly active, with ongoing efforts to increase the number of qubits, improve error rates, and develop useful quantum algorithms.
            <br /><hr />
            It's important to note that while classical computing has a long and well-established history, quantum computing is still in its early stages and much of its potential remains theoretical.
